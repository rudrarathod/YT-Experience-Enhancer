## üîß How It Works

The extension uses modern web technologies to seamlessly integrate with YouTube:

1. **Content Script Injection** - The `content.js` script runs on all YouTube pages
2. **DOM Manipulation** - Creates and injects button elements into YouTube's player controls
3. **Event Simulation** - Miniplayer button simulates pressing the "i" key
4. **Native PiP API** - Picture-in-Picture button uses browser's `requestPictureInPicture()` API
5. **Navigation Handling** - Listens for YouTube's SPA navigation events
6. **Mutation Observer** - Monitors DOM changes to ensure buttons persist
