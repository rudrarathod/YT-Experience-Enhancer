## üîß How It Works

The extension uses modern web technologies to seamlessly integrate with YouTube:

1. **Content Script Injection** ‚Äî The `content.js` script runs on all YouTube pages
2. **DOM Manipulation** ‚Äî Creates and injects button elements into YouTube's player controls
3. **Event Simulation** ‚Äî Miniplayer button simulates pressing the "i" key
4. **Native PiP API** ‚Äî Picture-in-Picture button uses browser's `requestPictureInPicture()` API
5. **Navigation Handling** ‚Äî Listens for YouTube's SPA navigation events
6. **Mutation Observer** ‚Äî Monitors DOM changes to ensure buttons and gesture controls persist
7. **Popup UI** ‚Äî All feature toggles, gesture sensitivity, and overlay options are managed live via the popup (no refresh required)
