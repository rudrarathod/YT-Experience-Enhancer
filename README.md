   - **Chrome**: Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - **Edge**: Navigate to `edge://extensions/`

   - **Opera**: Navigate to `opera://extensions/`

### Method 2: Install from Source

# Navigate to the folder
cd yt-mini-player-extention

# Follow steps 3-7 from Method 1 above
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### Using the Button

1. **Navigate** to any YouTube video
2. **Look** for the new miniplayer button in the video player controls (located next to the settings gear icon)
3. **Click** the button to activate miniplayer mode
4. The video will shrink to the bottom-right corner, allowing you to browse YouTube while watching

### Using the Keyboard Shortcut

Simply press the **`i`** key while watching any YouTube video to toggle miniplayer mode.

### Visual Guide

The miniplayer button appears here in the YouTube player controls:
```
[Play] [Volume] [Settings] [üî≤ Miniplayer] [Theater] [Fullscreen]
                              ‚Üë New button!
```

## üîß How It Works

The extension uses modern web technologies to seamlessly integrate with YouTube:

1. **Content Script Injection** - The `content.js` script runs on all YouTube pages
2. **DOM Manipulation** - Creates and injects a button element into YouTube's player controls
3. **Event Simulation** - Clicking the button simulates pressing the "i" key
4. **Navigation Handling** - Listens for YouTube's SPA navigation events
5. **Mutation Observer** - Monitors DOM changes to ensure the button persists
